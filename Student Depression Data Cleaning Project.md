# 📊 Student Depression Data Cleaning Project

This project demonstrates how to clean and process a real-world dataset related to student depression using **Python** and **Pandas**.

## 📁 File Included
- `student_depression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook performing data cleaning tasks.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧹 Key Cleaning Steps
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Standardizing data formats
- Renaming and organizing columns

## 💡 Goal
This is part of my journey in learning **Data Analysis**. The goal is to understand how to work with real-life messy data and prepare it for analysis or visualization.

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add data visualizations using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`
- Perform basic statistical analysis
- Use this cleaned data for building a predictive model later
